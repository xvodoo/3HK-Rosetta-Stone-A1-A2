## How to use

 **Adding time**
 
### Adding time in Foundations

* To add time to your Essentials product, go to your exercises. It's best to go to the empty Unite and select Vocabulary. You don't need to solve any questions. Next, pay close attention to the time field.
Each number is equal to multiple 8 times , so 1 = 8 | 2 = 16 minutes...
When you select the desired number, your time will be added.

### Adding Time in the Fluency Builder

* To add time to your Fluency Builder product, go to your exercises and open the add-on after entering the desired number. If you don't see a message saying "‚ùå Link, token, or body not found," this means no required information was recorded, so you should refresh the page or go to another exercise. If you see a message saying "‚úÖ Request #X done," this means the time has been added to the Fluency Builder.
